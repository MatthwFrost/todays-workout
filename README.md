# Today's Workout
I created this little tool because I don't like repetition. Waking up and doing 
the same workout over and over again. I decided to code something up to get a text 
every morning, that contains a different workout! 

The workout is generated to fit the skill level and the number of sets will represent that as well.

I am not a PT or have any qualifications in exercise, but I do have some friends 
helping out with listing all the exercises. (I have no clue myself)

## Updates
This is a very basic piece of software but I plan to expand it and allow other 
people to use this. I will be getting a few friends to try it out and tell me what they think.
JSON file and structure is a current problem. This will be updated to contain only 
types of workouts, and a custom generated workout will be made for the user.

## Current Issues
    - Data labels are constricted to days (want to label the data by the type of workout)
    - It's based off my current workout, (Which ties in with the first issue)
