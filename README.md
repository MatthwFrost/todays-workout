# Todays Workout

I created this little tool because I don't like repition. Waking up and doing
the same workout over and over again. I decided to code something up to get a
text every morning, that contains a  different workout!

The workout is generated to fit skill level and number of sets will represent that aswell.

I am not a PT or have any qualifications in exersise, but I do have some friends
helping out with listing all the exersises. (I have no clue my self)


## Updates
This is a very basic peice of software but I plan to expand it and allow other
people to use this. I will be getting a few friends to try it out and tell me
what they think.

Json file and stucture is a current problem. This will be updated to contain
only types of work outs, and a custom generated workout will be for the user.

## Current Issues

    - Data labels are constricted to days (want to labele the data by the type of workout)
    - Its based off my current workout, (Ties in with the first issue)
